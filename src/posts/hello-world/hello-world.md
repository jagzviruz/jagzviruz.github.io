It has been some time since I have blogged, and lately I have started itching
to start penning my notes again.
All my previous attempts have been to work with a full fledged CMS like Wordpress, which is just overkill for what I need. All I need is a place to note my observations while musing over stuff I do everyday.

So how is this "time" to be different? I cannot promise anything. All I can say, is I have done away with all the shiny tools that would distract me. So hopefully, I will be able to concentrate better on my subject matter.

This will be a place where I share my snippets, learning and tricks of my trade. If everything goes good, then this will be an invaluable repository for my personal use, and hopefully for others who come across it in due course of time.
